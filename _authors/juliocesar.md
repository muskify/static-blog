aidjaiosd [publishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishing "Publishing") and [graphic design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_design "Graphic design"), **_Lorem ipsum_** is a [placeholder text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placeholder_text "Placeholder text") commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content. _Lorem ipsum_ may be used before final [copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_(written) "Copy (written)") is available, but it may also be used to temporarily replace copy in a process called [greeking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeking "Greeking"), which allows designers to consider form without the meaning of the text influencing the design.

_Lorem ipsum_ is typically a corrupted version of [_De finibus bonorum et malorum_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_finibus_bonorum_et_malorum "De finibus bonorum et malorum"), a first-century BC text by the [Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic "Roman Republic") statesman and philosopher [Cicero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero "Cicero"), with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical, improper [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin "Latin").

Versions of the _Lorem ipsum_ text have been used in [typesetting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting "Typesetting") at least since the 1960s, when it was popularized by advertisements for [Letraset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letraset "Letraset") transfer sheets. _Lorem ipsum_ was introduced to the digital world in the mid-1980s when [Aldus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldus "Aldus") employed it in graphic and word-processing templates for its desktop publishing program [PageMaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_PageMaker "Adobe PageMaker"). Other popular [word processors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processor_(electronic_device) "Word processor (electronic device)") including [Pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pages_(word_processor) "Pages (word processor)") and [Microsoft Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word "Microsoft Word") have since adopted _Lorem ipsum_ as well.
